            Samusigapuram. Common crops grown include paddy, groundnut, cotton, and various vegetables. Farmers rely on
            both
            traditional and modern farming techniques.
            Cultural Practices: Villages like Samusigapuram observe traditional Tamil cultural practices, with festivals
            such as
            Pongal, Deepavali, and other regional celebrations being important aspects of life. Temples and religious
            rituals also
            hold a central place in the community.
            Community and Social Life: The village is likely to have a strong sense of community, where people maintain
            close
            relationships with one another and engage in shared activities, whether for religious, social, or
